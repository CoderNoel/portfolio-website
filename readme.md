## Overview

This is a portfolio website designed to showcase my skills, projects, and experience as a web developer. The website is designed to be simple, clean, and minimal, ensuring a great user experience across all devices. It features sections such as Home, About, Portfolio, and Contact.

## Features

- **Icon Color Change on Hover**: GitHub link icons change to a white-themed version on hover to improve visual feedback.
- **Responsive Image Swap**: The About section image changes based on the screen size for better display on mobile and desktop views.
- **Form Validation and Confirmation**: The contact form includes validation for required fields and displays a success message upon submission.
- **Hamburger Menu for Mobile View**: A hamburger menu appears on smaller screens, allowing users to toggle the visibility of the mobile navigation menu.
